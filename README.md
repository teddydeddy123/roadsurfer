React + TS

To run the project, please execute the followings commands, alternatively see the live version in the link below.

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`

I have completed all the mandatory requirements, omitting the optional ones since I am currently working and have limited time to focus on assignments.

*NOTES:*
STEPS TO FOLLOW:
1. Type in a location in the input bar above.
2. Choose from one of the suggested locations.
IMPORTANT: The calendar at the bottom is not going to display any events unless a location is selected.
3. Once you have selected a location, skim through the weeks until you find an event. (Be patient, this could take a while since events are spread out through calendar). The starting date for each one is marked in green, while the drop-off date is displayed in red.
4. Click on a booking event in the calendar to see further details about that booking.
